## üîç Introduction

Insider threats represent a critical concern for organizational cybersecurity, often resulting in severe data breaches and system compromises. These threats can be subtle, requiring advanced detection methods capable of understanding complex traffic behaviors.

The **CICIDS 2018 dataset**, a well-known benchmark in the intrusion detection research community, provides labeled network traffic, including multiple attack categories. This project utilizes the dataset to implement a machine learning-based detection system tailored to identify insider threats effectively.

## üìö Literature Review

Several machine learning and deep learning approaches have been researched for intrusion detection:

- **Random Forest**: Robust, interpretable, and effective at feature ranking.  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: High accuracy but computationally intensive.  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Good for capturing spatial/temporal patterns in data.

Key insights from previous work:
- Data preprocessing is essential: missing value handling, normalization, and class balancing.
- Deep learning models like CNNs, though originally for image tasks, are effective for sequential and structured data like network traffic.
- CICIDS 2018 remains a trusted benchmark for evaluating IDS solutions.
